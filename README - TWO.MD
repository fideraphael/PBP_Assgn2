	1. Synchronous does one task at a time and can only do another task if the first one is finished while asyncrhonous can do a few tasks at once parallelly
	
	2. Paradigms is used to synchronize the occurence of multiple events to simplify the program.

	3.a) Some event happens on a webpage.
	b) JavaScript creates an XMLHttpRequest object for that event.
	c) This object sends a request to the corresponding web server.
	d) The server processes the request and sends a response back to the browser.
	e) JavaScript reads the response.
	f) JavaScript executes an action based on said response, which is based on a triggering event.
	The entire process does not require a page reload, though it may contain it if defined by the programmer.
